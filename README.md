# Kaizntree-Dashboard

I have implemented Login Page and Item Dashboard webpages in this app and I have did everything on localhost.
I have used sqlite database for storing and retrival of data
To run the app:
  * Firstly in the terminal use `python3 manage.py runserver`
  * Then you can click on the local host url that is provided in your terminal
  * Once the url is open in your browser, you can create a new account or can login using existing credentials
  * After logged in you can see the item dashboard with Item count and Category count along with all the items retrived from the dashboard.
  * I haven't implemented funtions to create a item and to create a category in the frontend, although I have created views for the following in dashboard app. So, If an item or Category is to be added, Please use http://localhost:8000/admindashboard/item/
